// Day 2: Operators
// Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

//Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a=1; let b=2; console.log(a+b);
//Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
 a=1;  b=2; console.log(a-b);
//Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
 a=1;  b=2; console.log(a*b);
//Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
 a=1;  b=2; console.log(a/b);
//Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
 a=1;  b=2; console.log(a%b);

/*

 console.log(1 + 2);  -> 3
 console.log(1 + "2");  -> 12
 console.log("1" + 2); -> 12
 console.log(1 + 2 + "2"); -> 32
 console.log("1" + 2 + 2); -> 122

*/ 

// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
//Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

let add =1;
add += 2;
console.log(add);

//Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

let sub = 3;
sub -= 2;
console.log(sub);

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
//Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

console.log(3>5);
console.log(3<5);

//Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

console.log(5>=5);
console.log(5<=10);

//Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

console.log(5==5);
console.log(5===5); // Compare data types also.

/*

console.log(null > 0);  -> False
console.log(null == 0); -> False
console.log(null >= 0); -> True

Note: Comparisions convert null to number i.e 0 that is the reason why (3) is True.

*/

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
//Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.



//Task 12: Write a program that uses the II operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
//Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
//Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

// Feature Request:
// 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
// 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
